Execute a bash process that pipes the selected lines as if they were an input file, same as stdin, through a custom bash shell command. The output from the process replaces the selection with stderr and stdout. Works with multiple carets by piping each selection region separately into their own process. Also works with no carets. General usage instructions Invoke with ctrl-alt-shift-x, or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show the context menu. The menu item is called Pipe selected text to bash. When no lines are selected, use the keyboard shortcut to open the bash argument window. Demo Features Remembers the last command arguments Treats output containing either stderr and stdout the same Works with multiple carets, 1 caret and no carets Bug-free on Linux and Windows Actively supported - open an issue on github Unlicensed, free public domain source Note: you must have bash in your environment's PATH. Being able to run anything in the editor and change the buffer text was heavily inspired by emacs's lisp expressions (eval-last-sexp), (eval-defun) and (eval-expression).
